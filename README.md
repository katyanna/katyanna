#### Hi, I'm Katyanna 👩🏽‍💻

A software girl focused on platform engineering. 
Currently building infrastructure at scale @ [Zalando](https://www.corporate-zalando.com/), where we manage 200+ clusters, design custom CRDs, and contribute to open-source tooling.

**🛠 Main tech**
- Kubernetes
- Python & Go
- AWS-native infrastructure

**🚀 What matters to me**
- Building internal platforms that empower teams and make Kubernetes *boring*
- Designing infrastructure as product — reliable, automated, observable
- Clean, maintainable tooling with real-world use cases
